## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] — 2026-08-31

Multiple simulated Microducks cooperate: split the search, hold an auction, the closest
one kicks. Everything is on the record.

### Added

- **Flock mode** (`flock:` block in the `.duck`, or `--flock N` on `run`/`record`): 2 to 4
  ducks share one arena and an in-process message bus. A deterministic Contract Net
  auction picks the kicker (bid = each duck's own camera distance estimate, 20 %
  hysteresis, 6 s claim lease, duck-id tie-break, one-claimant lock), heading sectors
  split the search, misses trigger a full-circle re-search and re-auction, and a sim-time
  watchdog drops silent ducks. Every message, bid, claim and role change lands in
  `flock.jsonl`; the outcome is judged from sim ground truth, not a model claim.
  Guide: `docs/flock.md`. (ADR-0015)
- **Multi-duck simulator**: `World(n_ducks=…)` with per-duck deadman, noise streams, kick
  counters, duck-duck collisions and the four Microduck colorways (Cream, Sky, Lavender,
  Graphite); per-duck cameras render teammates, and the detector gained four `duck`
  targets. Sim time is governed by a lockstep clock, so the world freezes while any pilot
  thinks and single-duck runs stay bit-identical per seed. (ADR-0016)
- The planner makes **at most one** LLM call per flock run (parameters validated and
  clamped, deterministic fallback); `--provider fake` computes the plan as a pure
  function. Per-duck LLM pilots are deliberately out of scope.
- Duck to duck separation is watched from world ground truth while a claim is live: the
  coordinator orders an intruding non-kicker to retreat, and the retreat still runs
  through that duck's own executor.
- Starter `ducks/flock-kick.duck`; `runs/<ts>-flock-…/` layout with per-duck transcripts;
  flock demo GIF in the README. Scripted 3-duck acceptance: 10 of 10 seeds.
- The flock shipped through an adversarial review (69 agents, 24 confirmed findings, all
  fixed before release): deadlock guards around the shared clock's tick hooks and around
  member connect failures, per-duck `max_minutes` enforcement, a heartbeat watchdog floor
  above the longest verb sleep, cooldown gating at bid time, per-field planner clamping,
  `--max-steps` honoured on flock runs, `flock.search.restart_s` honoured, and
  `one_claimant: false` rejected instead of silently ignored.

### Changed

- `.duck` spec v0 gains the optional `flock:` block (`docs/duck-spec.md`, `schema.json`
  regenerated). Files using it need quackd 0.3.0 or newer; older versions refuse them
  loudly. `quackd validate` reports flock size and rejects flock + `verbs.confirm`.
- `quackd doctor` notes flock status; `serve-mcp` refuses flock ducks with a clear
  message.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-29

Local and open-source LLMs can pilot the duck. No API key needed.

### Added

- **Local providers** `ollama`, `vllm`, `llamacpp`, `lmstudio` and `local --base-url …`
  for any OpenAI-compatible server: no key, model discovery from `/v1/models`,
  `tool_choice=auto` and no `parallel_tool_calls` field for picky servers
  (`QUACKD_TOOL_CHOICE` overrides), vision opt-in with `--vision`, and a JSON text
  fallback for models that cannot call tools natively (marked `text_fallback` in the
  transcript). `quackd doctor` probes the four default local addresses.
  Guide: `docs/local-llms.md`. (ADR-0014)
- `quackd run --goal "…"`: a plain-language goal instead of a `.duck` file (ad-hoc contract:
  every `safe` verb, default budgets, standard abort rules). The scripted `fake` pilot picks
  a strategy from the goal's keywords.
- `--base-url`, `--api-key`, `--vision/--no-vision`, and `--gif-size` on `run`/`record`.
- Logo (`docs/assets/logo.svg`, a Microduck-like biped in the Lavender colourway) and a
  social-preview card.

### Changed

- README rewritten for people who know nothing about robots or LLMs first, developers
  second: what it does today vs. where it is going, Mermaid architecture diagrams, usage,
  configuration, performance and limitations sections. Images use absolute URLs so the
  PyPI page renders them. Providers are named by company ("OpenAI"), not model family.
- The hero GIF is recorded at 320 px panes.

### Fixed

- Rich markup ate `quackd[extra]` in CLI error hints.
- mypy on Python 3.12 (numpy's PEP 695 stubs) in CI.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-08-28

First release: sim-first, honest about hardware.

### Added

- **`.duck` spec v0**: strict pydantic frontmatter, generated `schema.json`,
  `quackd validate` with fail-fast field-level errors; five starter ducks
  (`hello-world`, `find-and-kick`, `patrol-and-quack`, `follow-me`, `fetch`) bundled in the
  wheel and resolvable by name.
- **Verb registry**: built-ins mapping 1:1 to shipped robot behaviours (`walk`, `sit`,
  `stand`, `kick`, `grab`, `stand_up`, `stop`, `quack`, `gaze`, `get_frame`), composites
  (`search_scan`, `walk_to`, `approach_and`), and the reserved learned-verb interface.
- **Safety executor**: allowlist, confirm gates, budgets, dry-run, machine-enforced
  `abort_when` (battery, consecutive failures), heartbeat, kill switch (Windows-safe).
- **Agent loop** with one tool call per turn, `runs/<ts>/transcript.jsonl`, frames,
  `summary.json`, and `run.gif` on the simulator.
- **`sim2d`**: built-in 2D simulator (deterministic under `--seed`, deadman, kick cone,
  unreliable open-loop scoop), top-down + first-person duck-cam renders, GIF recorder,
  optional `--live` window.
- **Perception**: `ColorBlobDetector` (HSV, bearing + distance from apparent size) and a
  lazy `YoloDetector` extra.
- **Providers**: `anthropic` (adaptive thinking, refusal handling, thinking-block replay),
  `openai`, `grok` (xAI endpoint), `gemini`, and the scripted `fake`; all vendor SDKs are
  optional extras.
- **`quackd serve-mcp`**: the duck as MCP tools for Claude Code / Claude Desktop through
  the same executor; `docs/mcp.md` with verified client config; project `.mcp.json`.
- **Transports**: `sim2d` (default), `mock`, experimental `jsonrpc` for the real robot
  (verified `duck-ipc-proto` v16 vocabulary, fake-robotd tests), `websocket` stub.
- **`quackd doctor`**, `quackd list-verbs`, `quackd record`.
- Docs: architecture, duck spec, transport status, safety, learned verbs (v2), licenses,
  FAQ, MCP; 13 ADRs; LAUNCH.md; CONTRIBUTING.md; hero GIF (scripted pilot, labelled).

### Known limitations

- The hardware transport has never run on a Microduck (hardware ships Christmas 2026).
- The README hero is a scripted-pilot recording; a real-model recording needs an API key.
- Non-Anthropic default model IDs are unverified; override with `QUACKD_MODEL`.
