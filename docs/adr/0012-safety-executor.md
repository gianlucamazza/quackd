# ADR-0012: One executor between every LLM and the transport

**Status:** accepted · **Date:** 2026-08-28

## Context

Two clients drive the duck: the agent loop and the MCP server (Claude Code / Desktop).
Both take instructions from a model. Upstream's `robotd` guards the body; something has to
guard the conversation, identically for both clients.

## Decision

`quackd.safety.Executor.run_verb(name, params, source)` is the only path to
`transport.send_intent`. In order:

1. **Abort flag** — set by heartbeat failure or kill switch → `Aborted`.
2. **Allowlist** — `.duck` `verbs.allow` (or, with no contract loaded, every verb whose
   `safety_class != "dangerous"`). `stop` is always allowed. → `VerbNotAllowed`.
3. **Params** — pydantic validation; errors return a failed `VerbResult` (feedback).
4. **Confirm gate** — `verbs.confirm` or `safety_class in {confirm, dangerous}` → a y/N
   callback (`typer.confirm` in the CLI, `--yes` to auto-accept). → `ConfirmDenied`.
5. **Budget** — `max_steps` counted here; `max_llm_calls` and `max_minutes` in the loop,
   with time from the transport clock. → `BudgetExceeded`.
6. **Machine-enforced `abort_when`** — battery threshold (from state) and consecutive
   failures per verb. → `Aborted`.
7. **Preconditions** — e.g. not fallen, not sitting → failed `VerbResult`.
8. **Dry run** — non-read-only verbs log and return without touching the transport.
9. **Execute** with `asyncio.wait_for(timeout_s)`; timeouts and exceptions stop the duck and
   return a failed result.

`Heartbeat` pings `transport.heartbeat()` every 500 ms; one failure → `stop()` + abort.
`KillSwitch` maps Ctrl-C and `q` to the same abort event (signal handler, not
`loop.add_signal_handler`, so it works on Windows). The loop always sends a final `stop`
and closes the transport in `finally`.

## Consequences

- MCP sessions get the same allowlist and budgets as `.duck` runs (M4 wires the same class).
- The physical rule still stands and is documented: on hardware the gamepad preempts
  remote control; quackd does not try to out-rank it.
- `--dry-run` is a first-class way to read what an LLM *would* do to a robot before
  letting it.
