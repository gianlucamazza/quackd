# FAQ

**Why is the simulator a cartoon?** Because the demo tests the *agent loop* — search,
approach, act, verify — not contact dynamics. Upstream's real simulator needs a GPU and
CC BY-NC-SA meshes we will not vendor. `sim2d` runs anywhere in seconds and the same
detector works on its duck-cam and on a real camera. ([ADR-0007](adr/0007-sim2d-cartoon.md))

**Does `uvx quackd run … --provider anthropic` work with no extras?** The default install
is light on purpose (no vendor SDKs). Use `uvx --from "quackd[anthropic]" quackd run …`, or
`uv pip install "quackd[anthropic]"`. Without the extra, quackd prints exactly that command.
`--provider fake` needs nothing.

**Which models are the defaults?** `anthropic` → `claude-opus-5`; `openai` → `gpt-5`;
`gemini` → `gemini-2.5-pro`; `grok` → `grok-4`. The non-Anthropic IDs were not verified
against vendor docs at release (no keys in CI) — override with `--model` or `QUACKD_MODEL`
if yours differs. Anthropic extras: `QUACKD_EFFORT` (default `medium`) and
`QUACKD_ANTHROPIC_FALLBACKS=0` to disable server-side refusal fallbacks.

**Are local LLMs supported (llama.cpp, vLLM, Ollama, LM Studio)?** Yes. They all speak
OpenAI's Chat Completions API, so `--provider ollama`, `vllm`, `llamacpp`, `lmstudio`, or
`local --base-url http://host:port/v1` works with no API key. Tool calling must be enabled
on the server (`llama-server --jinja`, `vllm serve --enable-auto-tool-choice
--tool-call-parser …`), vision is off unless you pass `--vision`, and a small model that
writes its tool call as plain JSON is still understood. Details: [local-llms.md](local-llms.md).

**How does the LLM "see"?** Providers with vision get the duck-cam PNG for the last two
turns; every provider gets a text line like `ball at bearing 12° left, ~0.80 m` from the
detector. Composite verbs steer on detections at 10 Hz and never wait for the model.

**Does the robot need a powerful onboard computer?** No. quackd's own process, the part
that calls the LLM and runs the detector, never runs on the robot itself — you run
`quackd run` on a laptop or a server, a network hop away, and it talks to the robot (or the
simulator) from there. The Open Duck Mini's official target, a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, only
ever runs its existing 50 Hz walk policy plus a small relay daemon that does run on the Pi
but does no perception and no inference of its own, just enough to swap the gamepad for a
socket ([`bridge/open_duck/`](../bridge/open_duck/README.md)). The Microduck's onboard
computer works the same way, through `robotd`. Nothing here needs an NPU or a bigger board
to keep up, because nothing model-shaped runs on the robot's own board in the first place.

**Does quackd use TOF or another depth sensor for obstacle avoidance?** Not yet. The only
sensing input today is a single colour camera: an HSV threshold (or optionally YOLO) gives
a bearing and an apparent-size distance to one named target, and `go_to` steers toward it —
there's no depth data, no occupancy grid and no general obstacle avoidance. The manifest
schema has a generic `tof` sensor slot for future adapters
([manifest-spec.md](manifest-spec.md)), and the Microduck's own `tofd` depth stream isn't
read yet either ([adapter-status.md](adapter-status.md)); the Open Duck Mini's official
build has no depth sensor at all.

**How do I tune the detector for a real orange ball?** `ColorBlobDetector` takes
`targets=(Target("ball", HSVRange(h_lo, h_hi, s_lo, v_lo), size_m=radius, round=True), …)`
in OpenCV HSV (H 0–180). Photograph the ball under your light, sample its hue, give ±8, and
set `fov_deg=62` for the IMX219. Distance comes from apparent size: measure the pixel radius
at 1 m once and adjust `size_m` until it reads 1.00. Or install `quackd[yolo]` and use
`YoloDetector`.

**Who decides the run succeeded?** The LLM, via `declare_success(reason)` — that is the
honest state of the art. In `sim2d` the run summary also records ground truth
(`ball_displacement_m`) and the tests check the claim against it.

**Why can't the duck say words?** Upstream has seven duck sounds and no TTS. `quack(text)`
maps your text to the closest tone (`greet`, `inquire`, `alarm`, `wheee`, …) and logs the
text.

**What does it cost?** A `find-and-kick` run is 3–8 model turns, each a few thousand input
tokens (mostly the system prompt and one image) and a short tool call. `transcript.jsonl`
records usage per turn.

**Windows?** Fully supported for sim, MCP and development. The real-robot `unix://` socket
is POSIX-only; forward it with `ssh -L 9870:/run/robotd.sock <robot>` and use
`--address tcp://127.0.0.1:9870`.

**Can I run it on my Microduck today?** `--robot microduck:jsonrpc` speaks the verified
`duck-ipc-proto` v16 vocabulary but has never touched hardware. Start with `--dry-run`,
read [adapter-status.md](adapter-status.md), and tell us what happened.

**Can I drive it from the Claude mobile app?** Not yet. `quackd serve-mcp` speaks `stdio`
only, so Claude Code and Claude Desktop spawn it as a local subprocess on the same machine
and talk to it over pipes. The mobile app reaches tools as remote connectors instead:
servers that run persistently at a network address with their own auth. quackd would need
an HTTP or SSE transport, a long-lived process, a reachable address and authentication
before a phone could talk to it. Roadmap, not shipped. The details are in
[mcp.md](mcp.md#why-not-from-my-phone-yet).

**Is control text-only?** Yes, from you — a `--goal` string, a `.duck` file, or a chat
message over MCP; there's no voice or GUI input. The loop isn't text-only end to end,
though: cloud providers also read the camera frame as an image each turn, and whatever
the model decides is always one of a fixed set of verbs (`walk_to`, `kick`, `quack`, …),
never a freeform command sent to the motors.

**Do I need to be near the robot to control it?** No — proximity isn't the constraint,
network reachability is. `robotd`'s socket only ever accepts connections from processes
on the robot's own computer, so reaching it from anywhere else always goes through a
network hop first (the same Wi-Fi, a VPN, or an SSH forward, as in the `Windows?` answer
above), and that works the same from across the room or across the world. Latency is what
actually matters: the deadman expects `robot.move` roughly every 100 ms, so a slow or
flaky link can stop the robot outright, regardless of physical distance.

**Is quackd production-ready?** No — it's a research prototype built around one trusted
local operator, not a hardened multi-user product. There's almost no authentication anywhere;
`.duck` files with a `flock:` block are refused over MCP for exactly that reason ("one
pilot, a flock needs a coordinator"), and nothing arbitrates two sessions driving the same
robot at once. Every real-hardware transport is experimental and unverified end to end
([adapter-status.md](adapter-status.md)); the CLI and MCP server are both thin callers of
the same executor and verb registry, so a real client like a phone app would mean adding a
network-reachable server and auth on top, not rewriting the core.

**Can I control who's allowed to pilot my robot?** Barely, and only on one body. quackd
adds no login or accounts, so access is mostly whatever your OS and network enforce.
`robotd`'s socket can't be reached off the robot's own computer unless something bridges
it, so the real gate there is SSH's authentication (and your Wi-Fi's), not quackd's;
`quackd announce`/`discover` do broadcast a robot's identity, unauthenticated, to anyone on
the LAN ([lan.md](lan.md)), though that's identity only, not a way to drive it. The one
exception is the Open Duck bridge, which quackd itself ships: it binds loopback, and if a
token file is configured it checks one with `hmac.compare_digest` before accepting a
handshake (`--token`, or `QUACKD_DUCK_TOKEN`). Its camera server has no authentication at
all, so tunnel it. On a Microduck the physical gamepad preempts remote commands; on an Open
Duck it does not, because quackd's daemon *replaces* the gamepad the walk loop reads, which
makes the power switch the only thing that always wins ([safety.md](safety.md)).

**What stops the model itself from doing something dangerous?** The executor, not the
model's judgment: every verb call is checked against the loaded `.duck`'s allowlist,
budgets and confirm gates before anything is sent, and machine-enforced `abort_when` rules
and preconditions (not fallen, not sitting) run right after — a refusal is enforced code,
not a request the model can talk its way around. That's still only the software layer; on
hardware the robot's own controller keeps the final word regardless (fall detection,
thermal clamps, and on the Microduck a deadman) — see [safety.md](safety.md).

**Does my data ever leave my machine?** Only if you choose a cloud provider. Claude,
OpenAI, Gemini and Grok each send the camera frame and prompt to that provider's API over
the network, under its own terms; the `fake` pilot and any local model (`ollama`, `vllm`,
`llamacpp`, `lmstudio`) never do and need no API key, though a local model is still served
over its own local HTTP endpoint, not literally air-gapped. See
[local-llms.md](local-llms.md).

**Can quackd drive something that is not a duck?** Since 0.4, yes: a robot is an adapter
that returns a manifest, and the verbs come from the manifest. `quackd list-adapters`
shows the five that ship (Microduck, Reachy Mini, a LeRobot arm, any base over
rosbridge, and an Open Duck Mini v2), `quackd list-verbs --robot reachy_mini:sim2d` shows what one of them can do,
and `quackd validate your.duck --robot lerobot:mock` tells you, field by field, whether
your task fits that body. The rule never bends: a verb that is not in the manifest does
not exist on that robot. Writing one: [adapters.md](adapters.md).

**Why does `validate` say "requires kick, but reachy-01 (reachy-mini) does not provide
it"?** Because it is true. A `.duck` lists what it needs (`requires`, or for a `duck: 0`
file its whole allowlist) and a head has no legs. Either pick a body that has the verb,
or write a task for the body you have; `reachy-spotter` is the head's own starter.

**Can two different robots share a task?** In the simulator, yes: `reachy-spots-duck-kicks`
puts a Reachy Mini head and a Microduck under one contract, the head spots and judges,
the duck kicks ([flock.md](flock.md)). On hardware, not yet: a flock across machines
needs a clock across machines, and nothing multi-robot has run on hardware.

**Why "quackd"?** Upstream names its daemons `robotd`, `mediad`, `padd`, `tofd`… the brain
daemon was missing. ([ADR-0002](adr/0002-name.md))
