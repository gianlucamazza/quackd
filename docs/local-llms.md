# Local and open-source LLMs

Yes, local models are supported. Anything that serves the OpenAI Chat Completions API with
tools works: llama.cpp's `llama-server`, vLLM, Ollama, LM Studio, and any other
OpenAI-compatible endpoint. No API key is needed.

```bash
uvx --from "quackd[openai]" quackd run find-and-kick --provider ollama --model qwen3:8b
uvx --from "quackd[openai]" quackd run find-and-kick --provider vllm --model Qwen/Qwen3-8B
uvx --from "quackd[openai]" quackd run find-and-kick --provider llamacpp
uvx --from "quackd[openai]" quackd run find-and-kick --provider lmstudio
uvx --from "quackd[openai]" quackd run find-and-kick --provider local --base-url http://gpu-box:8000/v1
```

The `openai` extra is the `openai` Python package, which is the client for all of these.
Leave `--model` off and quackd asks the server for its model list and takes the first one.

| `--provider` | Default address | Override |
|---|---|---|
| `ollama` | `http://localhost:11434/v1` | `--base-url` or `QUACKD_BASE_URL` |
| `vllm` | `http://localhost:8000/v1` | same |
| `llamacpp` | `http://localhost:8080/v1` | same |
| `lmstudio` | `http://localhost:1234/v1` | same |
| `local` | none, you must pass one | same |

`quackd doctor` probes all four default addresses and prints which servers are up and what
they serve.

## Server setup

Tool calling has to be switched on in some servers. These are the flags that matter.

**Ollama**

```bash
ollama pull qwen3:8b          # any model whose card says it supports tools
ollama serve                  # usually already running as a service
quackd run find-and-kick --provider ollama --model qwen3:8b
```

**llama.cpp**

```bash
llama-server -m model.gguf --jinja --port 8080     # --jinja enables the tool-calling chat templates
quackd run find-and-kick --provider llamacpp
```

**vLLM**

```bash
vllm serve Qwen/Qwen3-8B --enable-auto-tool-choice --tool-call-parser hermes
quackd run find-and-kick --provider vllm --model Qwen/Qwen3-8B
```

The `--tool-call-parser` value depends on the model family (`hermes` for Qwen and Hermes
models, `llama3_json` for Llama 3.x, `mistral` for Mistral). vLLM's docs list the pairs.

**LM Studio**

Developer tab → Start Server (default port 1234), load a model that supports tools, then
`quackd run find-and-kick --provider lmstudio`.

## What to expect from small models

quackd asks for exactly one tool call per turn. Frontier models do this reliably. Small
local models sometimes answer with JSON in plain text instead of a native tool call, or
call a verb that is not allowed, or add chatter. Three things make that workable:

1. **Text fallback.** If a reply has no native tool call, quackd looks for a JSON object
   like `{"name": "walk_to", "arguments": {"target": "ball"}}` in the text and uses it. The
   transcript marks those turns with `stop_reason: "text_fallback"` so you can see how often
   it happened. The system prompt tells local models this shape exists.
2. **One retry.** A turn with no usable call is re-prompted once, then counts as a failure.
   Budgets still apply.
3. **The executor never trusts the model.** A disallowed verb or bad parameters come back
   as feedback, not as robot motion.

Vision is off by default for local providers because most local models are text only and
servers reject image parts. The text observation already carries what the camera detected
(`ball at bearing 18° left, ~0.6 m`), which is the designed path. For a vision model
(qwen2.5-vl, gemma3, llava and friends) pass `--vision` or set `QUACKD_VISION=1`.

## Knobs

| Setting | Values | Default for local |
|---|---|---|
| `--model` / `QUACKD_MODEL` | any id the server serves | first entry of `/v1/models` |
| `--base-url` / `QUACKD_BASE_URL` | `http://host:port/v1` | the preset's address |
| `--api-key` / `LOCAL_API_KEY` | any string | `not-needed` (servers ignore it) |
| `QUACKD_TOOL_CHOICE` | `auto`, `required`, `none` | `auto` (`none` omits the field for servers that reject it) |
| `--vision` / `QUACKD_VISION` | on, off | off |

`parallel_tool_calls` is never sent to local servers, because some reject unknown fields.

## Honest notes

- Which local model pilots the duck well is an open question we have not measured. The
  loop was designed so that a weak planner degrades the task, never the robot's balance.
  There is exactly one data point, and it is not ours: the contributor who built memory
  between runs ran `find-and-kick` against **Qwen 2.5 Coder 14B on LM Studio**, seeds 5 and
  6, both successes with memory read and written, and reported that the model ignored a
  memory hint sitting in the system prompt but followed the same instruction once it was a
  numbered step in the `.duck` body. That is one model, one machine, two seeds, and no
  transcript in this repository. If you run one, please share the transcript in a
  Discussion: it is the cheapest way to make this section shorter.
- The cloud providers keep their stricter settings (`tool_choice="required"`,
  `parallel_tool_calls=False`). Only the local presets use the relaxed ones.
- Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp and LM Studio evolve quickly. If a flag above is stale, open an
  issue with the server version.
