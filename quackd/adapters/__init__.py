"""Robots are adapters: each one declares a `RobotManifest` and speaks the `RobotAdapter`
protocol, and the verb registry is built from that manifest at connect time (ADR-0017).

This package init imports nothing eagerly. `adapters.manifest` needs `verbs.registry` and
`verbs.core` needs `adapters.manifest`, so the re-exports below resolve lazily to keep the
import graph acyclic whichever module is imported first.
