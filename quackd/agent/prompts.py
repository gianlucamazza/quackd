"""Every word the LLM reads, in one place.

The system prompt carries the contract (in prose the model can act on) and the `.duck`
body verbatim. Each turn's observation is compact and structured — features, not frames —
with the image attached separately for providers that can see. One tool call per turn is
stated here *and* enforced by the loop; saying it is not the same as trusting it.

- Verbs marked confirm ({", ".join(fm.verbs.confirm) or "none"}) ask a human before running.
