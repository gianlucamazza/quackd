"""Finding quackd robots on a LAN: zeroconf (`_quackd._tcp.local.`) behind `quackd[lan]`.

The wire format (`txt.py`) is a pure module with no third-party import, so it is tested
without the extra. `announce` and `discover` import zeroconf lazily and take injectable
clients, so every test runs on fakes and the default install never imports zeroconf
(ADR-0021). A TXT record carries identity only (manifest id, digest, adapter, body); the
full manifest is fetched out of band and checked against the digest.
