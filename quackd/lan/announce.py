"""`quackd announce --robot <spec>`: advertise a robot's identity on the LAN.

What goes on the wire is a `ServiceRecord` built here with no zeroconf import, so the
record is testable and a fake registrar can receive it. Only the last step (turning the
record into a `zeroconf.ServiceInfo` and registering it) touches the library, and both the
registrar and that step are injectable. Announcing holds no robot connection: it is a
static manifest's identity, which is all a TXT record carries (ADR-0021).
