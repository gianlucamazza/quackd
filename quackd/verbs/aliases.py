"""Every verb alias quackd knows, in one place: old name -> canonical name.

0.4 renamed the duck-shaped core verbs (`get_frame`, `walk_to`, `walk`) to names any body
can carry (`observe`, `go_to`, `move`). The old spellings stay valid forever: shipped and
community `.duck` files use them, and a rename that breaks a task file is not a rename, it
is a regression. An alias exists in a registry if and only if its canonical verb does, and
nothing else in quackd may spell an alias mapping (ADR-0018).
