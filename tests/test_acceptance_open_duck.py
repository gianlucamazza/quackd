"""Acceptance for the Open Duck Mini v2: `open-duck-scout` with the scripted pilot, seeds 0..9.

`outcome == "success"` is the pilot's claim; the sim's ground truth (the duck actually
walked up to the ball) is checked too. The verbs this body does not have must never appear
in the transcript, because they do not exist in its registry at all.
