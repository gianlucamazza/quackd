"""M2 acceptance: with the scripted pilot, find-and-kick succeeds on >= 8 of seeds 0..9,
headless, in under 60 s each, and a GIF lands in the run directory.

`outcome == "success"` is the LLM's *claim*; the sim's ground truth
(`ball_displacement_m`) is checked too, so a lying pilot cannot pass this test.
